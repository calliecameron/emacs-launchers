# Emacs Launcher Scripts

The Emacs daemon is fantastic, but awkward to use. These scripts make
it more pleasant.

In each case:

- if the daemon is already running, use it; otherwise, launch a new daemon
- if the script has arguments, open each of those files
- if the script has no arguments:
  - check if data is being piped/redirected to stdin; if so, read the data and
    open it (so you can do things like `ls | emacs-daemon`, for example)
  - else, open a new frame or switch to an existing one (script-specific)

When opening a new frame, the scripts will detect whether you are in X, and open
the appropriate kind of frame. All the scripts also work in term.el buffers from
inside Emacs.

The difference between the scripts is how/if they open a new frame:

- `emacs-daemon` opens files in an existing frame, if possible
- `emacs-daemon-new-frame` always opens files in a new frame
- `emacs-daemon-terminal` always opens a new ncurses frame, even in X
- `emacs-daemon-blocking` always opens a blocking frame, even in X (useful as
  `EDITOR`)
- `emacs-daemon-path-open` searches for its arguments on `PATH`, rather than
  treating them as a normal path
- `emacs-daemon-dired` is like `emacs-daemon`, but only for directories

One additional script:

- `emacs-daemon-kill` prompts to shutdown any existing daemon

## Installation

Set `EMACS_LAUNCHERS_DIR` to point to this directory, then source `env.sh`.
Optionally source `alias.sh` too.

Make emacs-daemon the default program for text files in X:

```shell
xdg-desktop-menu install --novendor emacs-daemon.desktop

xdg-mime default emacs-daemon.desktop text/english text/plain text/x-makefile \
    text/x-c++hdr text/x-c++src text/x-chdr text/x-csrc text/x-java text/x-moc \
    text/x-pascal text/x-tcl text/x-tex application/x-shellscript text/x-c \
    text/x-c++
```
